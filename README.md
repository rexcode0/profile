Ashish Sharma // System Architect & Learner
I am a learner process running in the kernel of life, optimized for constant innovation and high-velocity updates.
The Processor: My mind operates on aggressive multithreading. What looks like overthinking is actually a high-bandwidth scan, allowing me to process multiple "sparse" topics simultaneously.
The Advantage: I’ve turned a high frequency of interrupts into a feature. It allows me to context-switch rapidly between low-level C/Rust logic and the physical silicon of ESP32 and IoT systems.
The Stack: From navigating Linux internals to building responsive web architectures, I bridge the gap between abstract code and raw hardware.
I don’t follow a linear execution path. I am a non-linear thinker built for a multidimensional tech landscape.
